                    <div class="description">
                        In Marshmallow a key aspect of the technical lead role is overlooking technical decisions in the multiple services handled by the team while still taking part to the team's work as an individual contributor.
                        Over time I have held the role in different teams. <br>
                        - I helped the team focused on growth and customer acquisition to go through its first scaling as the company was going through a massive increase of volumes as the business developed. <br>
                        - I was in charge of a time critical project to build systems allowing Marshmallow to sell insurance from its own insurance company and not be only a broker, which we were able to deliver in early 2021. <br>
                        - After that, I took the lead of the claims teams in charge of supporting the claiming aspect of the product as it went from one external partner to another and then with an in-house team.
                        This implied integrating with different partners as well as building internal tools for our teams to increase productivity and quality of service. <br>
                        - Lately I also started to support a second team in charge of delivering a telematics insurance product based on our mobile app.

                    <div class="description">
                        I joined the team in charge of growth and customer acquisition shortly after the product went live. 
                        I was strongly involved in further development of the product as well as in the evolution of processes, architecture and tooling in order to reach higher standards of service availability and developer efficiency.
                        We used Java with the Spring stack on the backend, with all of the services running in Docker containers hosted on AWS and the infrastructure defined with Terraform.
                        On the frontend side, we developed a React app, with elements in Typescript.

                        In the team in charge of developing the multi currency accounts (Borderless account) launched by the company in May 2017,
                        I was involved on the development of the project both in backend and frontend.
                        I took part in the development of several critical services (Java with Spring stack) and a big AngularJS application as well as some growing parts in React. 
                        I was also holding devOps roles with an on-call rotation and being involved in the strategical development of the product.
                        Our team developed services with a Domain Driven Design architecture and high availability and high reliability requirements in mind.
                        In term of infrastructure I had chances to get familiar with Kafka/Zookeeper, both MySQL and PostgreSQL in term of databases.

                        In order to be able to generate a CV independently of the platform I am on and not to get stuck with a provider
                        (being either Microsoft Word or Google Docs for example), I decided to write the base of my CV in plain HTML
                        and configure a small <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> image to use
                        <a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/" target="_blank">wkhtmltopdf</a> to generate the corresponding pdf file 
                        when needed.
