                        As a Staff Engineer for the Claims team, I am responsible for the technical direction of the three engineering teams supporting the needs from our claims operations teams. <br>
                        We achieve this by building both internal tools and customer facing solutions to handle all parts of the claims process and automating it as much as possible as well as integration with machine learning models developed by out data science teams.
                        We also ensure thorough auditability of our systems and reporting of any data change for business analytics as well as data science purposes.

                        In Marshmallow a key aspect of the technical lead role is overlooking technical decisions in the multiple services handled by the team while still taking part to the team's work as an individual contributor.
                        Over time, I have held the role in different teams.<br>
                        • I helped the team in charge of growth and customer acquisition to go through its first scaling as the company was going through a massive increase of volumes as the business developed.<br>
                        • I was responsible of a time critical project to build systems allowing Marshmallow to sell insurance from its own insurance company and not be only a broker, delivered in early 2021.<br>
                        • I then took the lead of the newly created Claims teams as claim handling went from one external partner to another and then with an in-house team.
                        This implied integrating with different partners as well as building internal tools for our teams to increase productivity and quality of service.<br>
                        • In addition to Claims, I started to support another team in charge of delivering a telematics insurance product based on our mobile app.<br>
                        • I led the a year-long project to migrate from an external claim management system to a totally new in-house built solution which is meant to be a core part of the company strategy to limit claims cost and its impact on loss ratio.

                        I was involved on the development of the project both in backend and frontend.
                        I took part in the development of several critical services (Java with Spring stack) and a big AngularJS application as well as some growing parts in React. 
                        I was also holding devOps roles with an on-call rotation and being involved in the strategical development of the product.
                        Our team developed services with a Domain Driven Design architecture and high availability and high reliability requirements in mind.
                        In term of infrastructure I had chances to get familiar with Kafka/Zookeeper, both MySQL and PostgreSQL in term of databases.

                        Allows one to handle keep track of their wine bottles in a cellar.
                        It has been quite of a long running project due to little time spent on it at once, but it's starting to take shape and has allowed me to get more familiar with Go and React in quite some aspects.

                        In order to be able to generate a CV independently of the platform I am on and not to get stuck with a provider
                        (being either Microsoft Word or Google Docs for example), I decided to write the base of my CV in plain HTML
                        and configure a small <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> image to use
                        <a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/" target="_blank">wkhtmltopdf</a> to generate the corresponding pdf file
